 ## Omise Public Key Note
 To work with the [Omise API](https://www.omise.co/docs) from a mobile application, you will need the public key. If you have not done so already, sign up for an account at [https://omise.co](https://omise.co) and visit your [Keys](https://dashboard.omise.co/test/api-keys) page to obtain it.
 
 After you get your public key, you can use it in this Playground by setting it in the every Swift file.
